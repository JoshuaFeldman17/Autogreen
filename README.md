## Key Features

- **Adaptive Grow Lights** — Automatically adjusts light intensity and duration based on plant needs
- **Self-Watering System** — Soil moisture sensors trigger watering events as needed
- **Environmental Monitoring** — Tracks temperature, humidity, and soil moisture
- **PID-Controlled Optimization** — Fine-tuned control of lighting and watering for optimal growth
- **Mobile/Serial Feedback** — View live plant stats and logs over Wi-Fi or Bluetooth (ESP32-based)
